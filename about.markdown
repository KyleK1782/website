### Abstract

HasMyWalletBeenPwned.com is a website that was developed to store vulnerable cryptocurrency wallets. These wallet vulnerabilities include easy-to-guess brain wallets as well as leaked cryptocurrency wallets. This project is based on the website Have I Been Pwned which informs the users if an account associated with an email address has been associated with a data breach or a data paste. This project utilized Jekyll as well as GitHub Pages to host this information for free. Utilizing the API, HasMyWalletBeenPwned.comcan look up vulnerable public keys that are stored in the database. This is a useful tool for cryptocurrency users to ensure their wallets are secure.
